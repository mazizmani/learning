JS learning

Hey, this is where I document my learning progress with JavaScript from scratch.

-Day1: learning basic variables, let, const, console.log and such.

-Day2: I learned how to manipulate strings with different methods such as .trim(), .slice(), .repeat(), .toUpperCase() and so on.

-Day3: I started out with making a couple "challenges" for my self to complete, I made a Click Counter, and a Text changer.

-Day4: This day I learned a lot about functions, Math methods and booleans.

-Day5: Today I deepened my insight on functions, while also incorperating the usage of arrays.
